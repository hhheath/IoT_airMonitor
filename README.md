# IoT_airMonitor

I made this so that I could "wirelessly" (I say becuase it still needs to be plugged into the wall) send temperature, pressure and humidity from a room in my house to the [Losant](https://www.losant.com/) IoT platform. I'm a huge fan of their products, and this was a way for me to test them out for myself. 

For a more detailed explanation you can check out [this YouTube video I made](https://youtu.be/xqXnAvt0DmY) on how I made this zombie code, and how it's all wired up.
